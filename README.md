# 📍 Geo Path Finder

**Geo Path Finder** is an interactive pathfinding visualizer built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.
It demonstrates how various pathfinding algorithms work step-by-step on a dynamic grid,
helping learners understand the logic behind graph traversal and shortest path discovery and make more curious to learn about Graph.

## 🔧 Features

- 🚀 Visualizes multiple pathfinding algorithms:
  - A* (A-star)

  - Breadth-First Search (BFS)
  - Depth-First Search (DFS)
  - Bidirectional Search
- 🧱 Maze Generation to test algorithms
- 👆 Click-to-select Start and End Nodes
- 🧱 Drag to create/remove walls
- 🎞 Real-time animations for traversal and path
- 📱 Responsive and beginner-friendly UI

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- **HTML**
- **CSS**
- **Vanilla JavaScript**
